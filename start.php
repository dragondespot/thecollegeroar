			<h2>Welcome to our website.</h2>
	        <h2>Thanks for visting!</h2>
	        <p id="indent">This website went online on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2015 with 
	           the purpose to provide the best and most up to date collection 
	           of information for U.S. colleges and universities.  The data 
	           available on this site was collected and published by U.S. 
	           Department of Education.
	        </p>
	        <br/>
	        <p id="indent">We have big plans to provide additional content and search options
	           to help perspective students and their families research colleges and
	           universities with the goal of making sure each student can find the 
	           college or university that suits them best.
	        </p>
	        <br/>
	        <p id="indent">While searching colleges for my own daughter, I realized that 
	           their is huge need to improve search options for families and 
	           provide a unbiased view of colleges and university.
	        </p>
	        <br/>
	        <p id="indent">During the next few months, we will be adding and improving the 
	           content contained within the website.  We will be adding additional 
	           search options, adding functions that will allow students to add colleges
	           and universities to a wish list and complete comparisons of selected
	           colleges and creating an area that will allow current students to 
	           publish details of their college experiences.
